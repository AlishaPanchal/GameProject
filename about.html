            Hello, player! This is Alisha Panchal, co-creator of Fiat Justitia (Let Justice Be Done). Welcome! 
            I hope you enjoy this game, but for now, here's a little something about me.
              <ul>
                <li>Personality: Weirder than weird, total bookworm and goody-two-shoes, is 100% a nightowl through and through,
                and is the one kid that "loves school" and studies 24/7.</li>
                <li>Likes...: Total bookworm = Loves reading and books (The physical copies, not the wretched "e-books"), 
                loves studying (It keeps me busy, don't come at me), likes playing the violin even though the struggle is real, 
                loves the summer even though is a spring baby (June 4th is close enough), is the most competitive person known to man,
                wants to sleep all day, every day.</li>
                <li>...& Dislikes: Hates HATES HATES the cold, a.k.a the winter (DOES NOT INCLUDE COLD WATER), 
                gets red in the face when people open the microwave before the timer can go off (People, if you can't wait, just hit the "Clear" button!), 
                dislikes lazy people even though wakes up years after the sun rises every weekend.</li>
              </ul>
          </p>

            Hello again, player! This is Caitlin Curtain, the other co-creator of Fiat Justitia 9let Justice Be Done). 
            I love games, all kinds of them. Board games, video games, physical games, some of my favorites are: 
            <ul>
                <li>Clue</li>
                <li>Minecraft</li>
                <li>The Manipulation Game</li>
            </ul>
           </p>
           <p>
            Those games have and always will be my favorite games (except for this one of course), but there's a specific reason why. 
            I like them not only because they're fun to play and I've made great memories while playing, but it's because of the kind of game they are. 
            I love problem solving and innovating and figuring out what I can do to be better, all three of those games let me do that.<br></br>
            When I'm not playing games I'm with my two best friends doing normal teenage girl stuff, going on Pinterest, watching out favorite movies (we're 
            suckers for Disney), don't get me wrong, we play a LOT of games too. One of my favorite kinds of games are the games that go along with books, I love 
            reading and anything that goes along with it, especially themed games to go along with the books. Same with TV shows, movies, or real life things. 
           </p>
