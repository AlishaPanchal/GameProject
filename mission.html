        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
          <p>The mission of Fiat Justitia (Let Justice Be Done) is to increase awareness about injustisce in the 
	    courtroom and the massive impacts of each decision on the people in courtroom. There is nearly no room for error
	    when determining who is guilty and who is innocent. In this game, players will be put in the shoes of judges, 
            the jury, lawyers, the guilty, and/or the innocent to understand how the justice system works.</p>
          </p>
	<h2>Data From Game Testing</h2>
	  <p>
	   While playtesting this game with other students, we collected numerous amounts of responses on our Post-Game Survey
	   Google Form to see what our players learned from our game. Here are some of the "Before" and "After" quotes 
	   from students that played our game.
	  </p>
	<h3>Before: What did you know about injustice in the courtroom and the justice system prior to playing our game?</h3>
	  <p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>"A lot but I didn't know what a bailiff was."</li>
	      <li>"I think I knew a good bit!"</li>
	    </ol>
	  </p>
	<h3>After: What do you know about injustice in the courtroom after playing our game? What did you learn from our game?</h3>
	  <p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>"I learnt where the bailiff stands."</li>
	      <li>"I know that its very easy to accuse the wrong person, or pin guilt on someone who is innocent, 
		   just because of some small thing they say. Without real evidence, it's difficult."</li>
	    </ol>
	  </p>
	<h2>Why is this Important?</h2>
	<p>
	The social issue of injustice in the courtroom is an issue that is important, yet often overlooked.
	The decision of one person or a group of people can detrimentally or beneficially change an individual's life
	and if this system is corrupted, then how can we expect the world to become a better place? These decisions 
	should be in the hands of people who we can trust to make the right decision, so criminals can be punished for 
	their wrongful crimes and innocent civilians can continue to live a safe, healthy, and prosperous life. Fiat Justitia
	is a game that brings this social issue to light and truly shows the players how one decision can save or wreck a
	person's life.
