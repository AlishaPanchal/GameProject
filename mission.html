        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
          <p>The mission of Fiat Justitia (Let Justice Be Done) is to increase awareness about injustisce in the 
	    courtroom and the massive impacts of each decision on the people in courtroom. There is nearly no room for error
	    when determining who is guilty and who is innocent. In this game, players will be put in the shoes of judges, 
            the jury, lawyers, the guilty, and/or the innocent to understand how the justice system works.</p>
