            Welcome to the Resources Pages! Here, we have included the links to ALL of our work on this project thus far. Currently, it is organized in a 
            Folder, which contains a variety of Google Docs, Google Forms, Python code, images, and other links. Everything is available for you to see! Consider this 
            a Behind-The-Scenes section where you'll throw open the door to reveal the work of the mad scientists. Once again, thank you all so much for playing our game, 
            Fiat Justitia!
            </p>
            <p>List of resources here. Ask Mr. Sinusas how to do this.</p>
