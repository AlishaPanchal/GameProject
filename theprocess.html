    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Fiat Justitia: The Process of Creating a Game</h3>
        <p>
        The journey to creating the game to see in front of you was long and hard. We faced many challenges and obstacles along the path, 
        none of which were easy to solve. We would like to take you, player, through the journey of creating Fiat Justitia and more generically, 
        creating a game. Are you ready?
        </p>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Step #1: The Idea</h1>
        <p>To begin creating a game, you first need to have an idea. For us, the idea was created in a pressurized moment in class. We quickly 
        realized that we both loved reading murder mystery and were quite knowledgeable in this topic as well, and soon we were discussing murder 
        in a courtroom. Of course, we had to have a social issue, so we eventually ended up linking our idea to the effects of injustice in the justice system. We began by 
        simply rambling about the possibilities of the plotline of our unnamed game, writing down the ideas we thought were more developed than others. 
        Finally, after a few class periods of brainstorming, we decided on the characters, the rough plotline, and some of the components we would need 
        to bring our game to life.
        </p>
   <h3 style="text-align:center;">Step #2: Development</h3>
        <p>
        The next step in creating this game was to start expanding on our brainstormed ideas. We worked on a Google Document called the 
        "Concept Clarification Organizer," which helped us develop our idea and solidify it. At this stage, we had the majority of the plotline, characters, and 
        player objects planned out. We made a bulleted list of the pre-, during, and post-game events, which would later be expanded upon even more. If you would like 
        to see this document, it is linked in the "Resources" page, and you can also access it by clicking 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xu4hyISAF2xmk-iGM-Qo2P4sAh_BjmLmUoRWnH7yTk0/edit?usp=sharing">here!</a>
        </p>
   <h3 style="text-align:center;">Step #3: Create Your Game!</h3>
        <p>
        This final step may seem repetitive, but we can only explain so much at once. After creating our "foundation", we began building. The cards, Rule Book, Game Board, 
        and all of the other components in the Fiat Justitia Game Box began coming together piece by piece over the course of multiple classes. Fiat Justitia is still a game in progress, 
        and we are always trying to take your feedback to improve our game! We warn you, this step is going to be the hardest because of its complexity. It is essential to keep a tracker 
        of some sort to help you and/or your team stay on track to completing your game. Our tracker was in a Google Doc, once again, in an organized table with columns for the member 
        responsible for the task, links of the work for the task, a description of the task, the progress on the task, and the task's overall priority. We called this the "Project 
        Tracker Table" and it was in our "Game Project Collaboration Coordination Doc." Once again, this has been linked in the "Resources" page, and it is also 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GBlo2E4Vu8E9RpYuebgbgDNTdBECf4C_s0fWXLHZ8Cw/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>
        </p>
   <h3 style="text-align:center;">Step #4: ...HAVE FUN!</h3>
        <p>
        Okay, so we lied. There is one more step...to HAVE FUN! You (and possibly your team) have worked so hard to bring your idea to life! Now it's time to relax and enjoy the 
        fruits of your labor (It's clich√©, I know.). Play your game yourself or with your friends. You can even playtest with random strangers to see what you can do to further improve 
        in your game to make it better, or, in our case, see your friends put on their best acts! Just remember to give yourself a round of applause or a pat on the back for all 
        of your hardwork! You deserve it! Good luck, future game creators, and thank you for joining on the process of creating a game.
