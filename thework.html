        <h1>Fiat Justitia: The Work</h1>
        <p>
        Welcome to "The Work" page, players, where we show you a collection of the components we made for Fiat Justitia. Consider this a
        gallery walk. Enjoy!
        </p>
        <h2>Component #1: The Game Box</h2>

        </figure> 
        <p>
        The Game Box is where all of the components of Fiat Justitia are stored. The front has the Fiat Justitia logo, which was printed using the Silk Screening technique, 
        and red paint to indicate blood. For creative purposes, we, the co-creators, also put our handprints in red paint as well. The one on the left is Caitlin's, 
        while the one on the right is Alisha's. The thumbprints are also Caitlin's.
        </p>
        <h2>Component #2: The Game Board</h2>

        <p> 
        The Game Board is a visual top view of a typical courtroom. It consists of the judge's table, the jury box, the transcriber's desk, the witness stand, 
        three counsel tables (Left, Middle & Right), and the public seating area. There are also multiple sets of doors around the room. The Game Board can be used to visualize 
        where the bailiff is murdered, each player's position, and overall, what a courtroom looks like in real life. 
        </p>
        <h2>Component #3: The Cards</h2>

        This is the deck of playing cards. They include the role, wild, question, answer, divider, and title cards, all of which are explained below. These cards are essential 
        to Fiat Justitia. They also took the most time to make because they refused to cooperate!
